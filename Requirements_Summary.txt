Task 1 — RFQ → CRM Automation (No-Code + LLM Optional)


Objective:
Automate the complete RFQ (Request for Quotation) processing pipeline — from incoming email to CRM mock logging and team alert.


Core Workflow Steps:
1. Capture incoming RFQ emails through IMAP trigger.
2. Deduplicate messages using Google Sheets lookup.
3. Detect and translate email language (LLM – Google Gemini).
4. Extract key fields (SKU, Quantity, Delivery City, Client Info).
5. Append parsed data to two Google Sheets:
   • RFQ_Master_Log
   • RFQ_Parsed_Details
6. Create an opportunity record in a robust mock CRM.
7. Archive attachments to Google Drive.
8. Send auto acknowledgment to client via Gmail.
9. Post internal alert to Slack channel.
10. Update final workflow status in Sheet.


Deliverables:
• Workflow JSON (sanitized)
• Sample Google Sheet + Drive link
• CRM Mock Log (JSON)
• Example Input Email + Output Data JSON
• Auto Reply Sample
• Error Log
• Screenshots + Video Demo (3–7 min)
• README + .env.example


Outcome:
A fully automated, multi-system workflow that captures RFQ emails, processes data intelligently, logs them, notifies internal teams, and responds to clients automatically.
